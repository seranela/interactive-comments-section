## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The responsive layout was rather straightforward. Although, implementing the functionality was more involved. Using vanilla JavaScript, I roughed together each component into a working state. It's not fancy, but it works. Had to download Firefox Developer edition so I could have a browser without setting modifications and "hardening" done to it. I would like to refactor this into something more efficient while adding that fancy flair to it. I'll need to research further into this.
